# **SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker**

## **About the Project**

### **Overview**

This project is a command-line application designed to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. The application allows business owners to efficiently view and manage departments, roles, and employees, ensuring that the company's organization and planning processes are streamlined.

The application is not deployed; instead, a walkthrough video demonstrates its functionality, covering all the acceptance criteria. This video should be included in the README of the project.
